# This New Bionic Knee Is Changing the Game for Lower Leg Amputees

Scientists have developed a prosthesis that is directly integrated with muscle and bone in order to improve movement.

Biomechanists have just created a revolutionary bionic knee that helps amputees with a remarkable range of movement. Traditionally, lower leg prostheses are an external device. An amputee’s stump is fixed with a socket upon which a robotic limb is attached. But now, researchers at MIT have developed a prosthesis that is directly connected to a patient’s bone and muscle tissue, and it feels more like a part of their own body.

But now, researchers at MIT have developed a prosthesis that is directly connected to a patient’s bone and muscle tissue, and it feels more like a part of their own body.

Since 2017, a team of scientists at MIT’s Yang Center for Bionics—co-led by biomechanist Hugh Herr—have been working to develop better, more advanced prostheses that are integrated into an amputee’s body. In a new study published last month in Science , the researchers have brought together different technologies to create a tissue-integrated, above-the-knee prosthesis that gives people more control over their movements.

We actually are pushing the definition of what a prosthesis can be, and that’s why we say it’s a tissue-integrated prosthesis, Tony Shu , lead author of the study, says. There’s a part that you will never be able to take off without another surgery. Shu likes to think of the new prosthesis as a culmination of three layers.

In the heart of the enigmatic forest, where the ancient trees formed a cathedral of intertwining branches and the soft, dappled sunlight filtered through the verdant canopy in a mosaic of fleeting golden beams, a hidden clearing emerged like a secret sanctuary, where the air was thick with the intoxicating aroma of wildflowers and the gentle hum of bees, creating an ephemeral haven that seemed untouched by the relentless march of time.

Enveloped by the twilight's gentle embrace, the once vibrant carnival now lay abandoned, its faded tents and rusting rides casting long, mournful shadows across the cracked pavement, while the distant echo of an old, forgotten carousel melody mingled with the soft rustling of autumn leaves, creating a poignant tapestry of nostalgia and melancholy that lingered in the cool, evening air. High above the sprawling metropolis, where the labyrinth of city lights flickered like a constellation of artificial stars against the backdrop of the velvet night sky, the solitary figure perched on the rooftop surveyed the endless sea of concrete and steel below, their mind drifting through the tangled web of dreams and ambitions that mirrored the intricate patterns of the illuminated streets, as the cool breeze carried whispers of forgotten stories and distant promises.

Nestled within the mist-covered mountains, where the ancient pine trees stood like silent sentinels guarding the secrets of the earth, the secluded monastery clung to the rugged cliffs, its weathered stone walls etched with the passage of centuries, while the faint tolling of a distant bell reverberated through the crisp morning air, echoing the monks' unbroken rhythm of prayer and meditation, as if time itself bowed in reverence to the sacred tranquility of the place.

As the first rays of dawn pierced the horizon, painting the sky in hues of amber and rose, the vast desert landscape slowly awakened, its rolling dunes casting elongated shadows that danced with the shifting sands, while the solitary figure trudging across the endless expanse felt both the weight of isolation and the profound silence that stretched infinitely in every direction, as if the very essence of time was suspended in the breathless stillness of the morning.

Beneath the vast expanse of the star-studded night, where the cosmos unfolded in a dazzling display of celestial wonder, the lone astronomer stood atop the windswept plateau, his gaze fixed on the distant galaxies swirling in the inky depths of space, while the quiet hum of the universe filled the air with a profound sense of awe, as if the very fabric of reality was whispering secrets of existence that transcended the limits of human understanding.

Under the weight of the storm-laden sky, where dark clouds churned like a tempestuous sea and flashes of lightning illuminated the jagged peaks of the distant mountains, the small village huddled in the valley below seemed almost fragile, its flickering lanterns struggling against the encroaching darkness, while the wind howled through the narrow streets, carrying with it the ominous scent of rain and the foreboding promise of nature's untamed fury.

Amid the ancient ruins, where weathered stones bore silent witness to the rise and fall of forgotten empires, a soft breeze stirred the overgrown vines that clung to the crumbling walls, carrying with it the faint scent of jasmine and the distant murmur of a hidden stream, as the lone traveler, standing at the edge of history, felt the weight of centuries pressing down, intertwining the echoes of the past with the fleeting moments of the present.

In the heart of the ancient cathedral, where the towering stained glass windows cast a kaleidoscope of colors onto the cold stone floor, the solemn silence was punctuated only by the distant echo of footsteps and the soft murmur of a lone chant, as the ethereal light bathed the worn pews and the intricately carved altars in a reverent glow, creating an atmosphere where time seemed to dissolve into the sacred stillness of the moment.

A gentle breeze carried the scent of blooming jasmine through the quiet, moonlit garden.

The first of these such layers is at the neuromuscular level. In an able-bodied person, Shu explains, at least two muscles pull against each other to move a joint, a relationship researchers refer to as agonist-antagonist—or the phenomenon in which one muscle stretches as another contracts. This relationship is what creates proprioception, or the sense that even when you close your eyes and move your elbow, for example, you know where your arm is in space.

In a traditional amputation, this relationship is disrupted, and severed muscles are simply used to pad the prosthetic socket, disrupting one’s sense of control and proprioception. However, when a surgery is conducted to reconnect severed muscles—what researchers call an agonist-antagonist myoneural interface, or AMI—the muscles’ natural relationship to each other is restored.

In 2024, the MIT lab showed that below-the-knee amputees who had received this special surgery had better control than traditional amputees. This time, Herr’s team took such advancements a step further, combining the surgery with the second layer of the new prosthesis. A titanium rod was inserted into an amputee’s residual bone—in this case, a femur bone above the knee—to allow for more comfort and better movement control compared to the traditional socket. The addition also enabled better load bearing. In the past, the prosthesis would put pressure on soft tissue instead of bone, creating discomfort for amputees. Imagine sweating into a hard carbon fiber shell all day and the chafing as your residual limb slides up and down the socket, Shu explains.

Additionally, wires were connected to electrodes implanted within muscle tissue. These wires were then routed to the external robotic controller that helps move the prosthesis. The third layer of the prosthesis is what Shu refers to as the mechatronics layer, or the robotic limb that is then attached directly to the titanium implant.
