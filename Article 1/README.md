# This New Bionic Knee Is Changing the Game for Lower Leg Amputees

Scientists have developed a prosthesis that is directly integrated with muscle and bone in order to improve movement. Biomechanists have just created a revolutionary bionic knee that helps amputees with a remarkable range of movement. 

Traditionally, lower leg prostheses are an external device. An amputee's stump is fixed with a socket upon which a robotic limb is attached. But now, researchers at MIT have developed a prosthesis that is directly connected to a patient's bone and muscle tissue, and it feels more like a part of their own body.
