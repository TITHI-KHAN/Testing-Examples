# Were Humans in Thailand Getting High Off Betel Nuts 4,000 Years Ago?

<p>Experts believe they have found the earliest biochemical evidence of people chewing the popular psychoactive plant.</p>

<p>From South Asia to the Pacific islands, people chew betel nut. When munched by habitual users, the seed of the areca palm fruit stains the teeth. And the practice—which typically involves the nut being chewed inside a betel pepper leaf with lime—has reported psychoactive effects , including increased alertness and euphoria.</p>

<p>However, due to its high link with oral cancers , the practice has steadily gone out of fashion. Government involvement measures have also dissuaded use. In the 1940s, the government in Thailand, for example, launched a planned effort to cut down on betel nut chewing. India, too , has promoted planned efforts to discourage the traditional practice.</p>

<p>Now a new study , published this week in the journal Frontiers in surrounding area past cultures , aims to show light on the history of betel nut chewing. By providing the first direct biochemical evidence of chewing dating back 4,000 years in Southeast Asia, the study helps make stronger that betel nut eating is a repeated practice that has been done for centuries.</p>

<p>Piyawit Moonkham , an anthropological past cultures expert at Chiang Mai University in Thailand and study co-author, grew up watching his grandparents chew betel nut. He says that although the plant has undeniable health results, chewing may have been done through history for those seeking health benefits, including possibly for stress relief and care for mental illness . Moonkham hopes that by using past cultures to better understand the longstanding history of betel nut use, people are able to see the plant from a more nuanced point of view.</p>

<p>In order to test whether the remains showed evidence of betel nut eating, researchers analyzed 36 samples of dental calculus from six people at the Nong Ratchawat burial site in Thailand. Picture the calcified film that’s scraped from your teeth when you get a deep cleaning at the dentist.</p>

<p>Roger Forshaw , a biological anthropologist at the University of Manchester in England who was not involved in the study, says that dental calculus is like a past cultures time container, because it doesn’t deteriorate and can keep microscopic evidence from a person’s life such as the diet they may have eaten.In the study, researchers identified arecoline and arecaidine as the main determining mixtures of betel nut chewing remains.</p>

<p>The mixtures were identified in a sample made to mimic betel nut eating—using a mix of dried betel nut fruit, pink limestone paste, betel leaves and saliva. Experts were then able to find the mixtures in three of the 36 samples, all linked with a single female burial from 4,000 years ago.</p>

<p>According to Shannon Tushingham , an anthropologist at the California school of Sciences and study co-author, this doesn’t absolutely mean that the other people in the burial site did not eat betel nuts. Though this specific person may have been special to her group, a variety of other factors including the extent of people’ betel nut use and the conditions of their keeping safe may have also affected the researchers’ ability to detect eating.</p>
