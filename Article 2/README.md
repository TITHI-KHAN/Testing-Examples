# What Happened to the Bone-Crushing Dogs That Once Hunted Across North America?

<p>Before going extinct roughly two million years ago, canids known as borophagines took down and ate much larger food.</p>

<p>Long before coyotes and millions of years before wolves, bone-crushing dogs padded across North America. The prehistoric canids came in an array of sizes, from small nippers like foxes to huge, bone frame-busting predators larger than the largest gray wolf. For more than 31 million years, they were among the most able to do many things carnivores on the land mass, and remainders of their prehistoric meals indicate that they truly did eat more bones than other canids. But by 1.8 million years ago, they were all gone.</p>

<p>Fossil experts know bone-crushing dogs by their official name, borophagines. The short, deep muzzles of the canids have often reminded fossil experts of spotted hyenas, carnivores that are more closely related to cats than dogs. These dogs evolved jaw specializations to crack open and eat more bone than predators like wolves do. But as experts have continued to study them, they’ve found that the predators were not simply dogs acting like hyenas.</p>

<p>The canids hunted during a span when grasslands populated by very big herbivorous animals like camels, rhinos, horses and elephants were spreading with them, and these animals had the ability to break large carcasses into splinters. The earliest These dogs evolved in North America about 34 million years ago.</p>

<p>The canids evolved from earlier dogs that were lankier and more civet -like. Some remained a little small and were more omnivorous, similar to foxes and coyotes today. But many evolved to be some of the largest carnivores in their ancient homes. Borophagus itself, whose name means - gluttonous eater, was about the same size as a large coyote. Epicyon was even larger, the biggest dog of all time, standing three feet tall at the shoulder and weighing more than 300 pounds. The tall, short-snouted skulls of these large, bone-crushing forms would have made the dogs look more cat-like than wolf-like. Much like cats and hyenas, the These dogs evolved to prioritize jaw crushing power over faster bites. Borophagus , Epicyon and their relatives first came to the attention of fossil experts in the late 19th century, and they were interpreted as dogs with powerful bites very early on. Strong, worn-down cheek teeth found in the jaws of the canids left little doubt that they were often eating bones.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t until 2018 that fossil experts finally found better proof: old remains animal poop packed with bone shards. In rocks roughly six million years old, fossil experts found a latrine of old remains feces left behind by Borophagus , their bones found in the same area.</p>

<p>When Natural History Museum of L.A. area fossil expert Xiaoming Wang and colleagues examined the contents of the feces old remains, they found bone pieces that had not been fully digested. The shards also showed that Borophagus hunted for food on herbivores larger than itself, animals that were between 77 and 220 pounds. That would be the same as a coyote hunting mule deer. No modern North American carnivore is capable of crushing bones like them could, Wang says. At the same time, he notes, the dog wasn’t exactly like spotted hyenas, either.</p>
