# As Interest in Deep-Sea Mining Grows, Scientists Raise Alarms About the Possible Ecological Consequences

<p>Gathering minerals such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and lithium from the seabed could affect everything from sponges to whales. The long-term effects of these extractions remain uncertain.</p>

<p>The deep sea is an extreme environment featuring crushing pressure, near-freezing temperatures and total darkness. It can be hard for humans to imagine anything capable of withstanding such conditions. And yet, life persists.</p>

<p>In rare trips to the deep sea, scientists have uncovered sea cucumbers with purple-magenta ombre coloring; yeti crabs with hairy, feather-like claws; octopuses with ears like the Disney character Dumbo; iridescent mollusks; and phantasmic jellyfish.</p>

<p>This life is all but a fraction of what scientists suspect exists on the deep seafloor. But just as researchers are beginning to discover the multitude of species that call the ocean floor home, countries around the world are already making plans to mine it. Minerals on the deep seafloor were discovered in most oceans in the 1870s during the Challenger expeditions. However, interest in mining these minerals was not popularized until the mid-20th century, when American geologist John L. Mero, known as the “father of ocean mining,” promoted the practice in his 1965 book The Mineral Resources of the Sea.</p>

<p>Global demand for critical minerals found in seabed areas—like nickel, cobalt, manganese and lithium—are on the rise. Currently, these minerals are most commonly mined in Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Australia, respectively. Many of these sites have been accused in recent years of committing a variety of human rights and labor abuses. Concerns about the longtime viability of such mines are also leading companies to look for minerals elsewhere.</p>

<p>These minerals are used in defense technology, smartphones, electric vehicles and even medical devices. The International Energy Agency predicts that by 2040, demand for these minerals from clean energy technologies will at least double under one scenario. So now, the prospectors are turning to the depths of the ocean. The International Seabed Authority, the body in charge of approving exploration and development of deep-sea mining projects in international waters, has currently issued 31 mineral exploration contracts, but it has not yet approved any commercial mining operations, as the regulations for such activities are still under review. Meanwhile, 37 countries have so far taken positions against deep-sea mining on international waters, citing potential environmental harms.</p>

<p>Last month, the Trump administration announced that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management would begin to fast-track the development of deep-sea mining projects. The move follows an executive order President Donald Trump released in late April calling for the expedition of domestic and international deep-sea mining projects as a means of strengthening our economy, securing our energy future and reducing dependence on foreign suppliers for critical minerals. The debate surrounding deep-sea mining represents an interesting tension, as the minerals it produces help power many of the technologies that countries need to achieve sustainability goals such as reducing reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
