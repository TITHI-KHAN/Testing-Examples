    <h1>This New Bionic Knee Is Changing the Game for Lower Leg Amputees</h1>
    <p>Scientists have developed a prosthesis that is directly integrated with muscle and bone to improve movement.</p>

    <p>Biomechanists have developed a new bionic knee that helps amputees move more freely. Traditionally, lower leg prostheses are external devices. An amputee’s stump is fixed with a socket to which a robotic limb is attached. However, researchers at MIT have developed a prosthesis that is connected directly to a patient’s bone and muscle tissue, making it feel more like a part of their body. Since 2017, scientists at MIT’s Yang Center for Bionics, led by biomechanist Hugh Herr, have been working on better prosthetics that are integrated into the body.</p>

    <p>“We are redefining what a prosthesis can be,” says Tony Shu, lead author of the study. “There’s a part that you can never remove without another surgery.” Shu describes the new prosthesis as having three layers.</p>

    <h2>First Layer: Neuromuscular Integration</h2>
    <p>The first layer is at the neuromuscular level. In a healthy person, two muscles work against each other to move a joint, a relationship known as “agonist-antagonist.” This creates proprioception, or the ability to know where a body part is even with your eyes closed. In a traditional amputation, this relationship is lost, and severed muscles only pad the prosthetic socket, disrupting control and proprioception. However, when a special surgery reconnects severed muscles, called the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface, the relationship is restored, improving control.</p>

    <h2>Second Layer: Bone Integration</h2>
    <p>A titanium rod is inserted into the femur above the knee, offering better comfort and control compared to the traditional socket. This layer provides better load bearing and reduces discomfort caused by soft tissue pressure, something traditional prostheses struggle with.</p>

    <h2>Third Layer: Robotic Integration</h2>
    <p>Additionally, wires connected to electrodes implanted in muscle tissue were routed to the external robotic controller that moves the prosthesis. The third layer of the prosthesis is the “mechatronics layer,” or the robotic limb attached to the titanium implant.</p>
