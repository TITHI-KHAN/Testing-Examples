# These Super-Resolution Microscopes Are Revealing the Inner Lives of Cells

<p>Advanced light microscopic viewing ways are giving experts a new understanding of human biology and what goes wrong in diseases.</p>

<p>Using a tiny, spherical glass lens sandwiched between two metal plates, the 17th-century Netherlands microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was the first to officially describe red blood cells and sperm cells in human tissues, and watch animalcules—bacteria and protists—in the water of a lake.</p>

<p>Getting stronger light microscopes followed, revealing cell organelles like the center and energy-producing mitochondria. But by 1873, experts came to know there was a limit to the amount of detail. When light passes through a lens, the light gets spread out through diffraction. This means that two objects can’t be recognized as different if they’re less than roughly 250 nanometers (250 billionths of a meter) apart—instead, they’ll appear as a blur. That put the inner workings of cell designs off limits.</p>

<p>Electron microscopic viewing, which uses electron beams instead of light, offers higher resolution. But the resulting black-and-white images make it hard to tell key molecules apart, and the method only works on dead cells.</p>

<p>Now, however, visual engineers and physicists have developed clever tricks to overcome the diffraction limit of light microscopes, opening up a new world of detail. These “super-resolution” light microscopic viewing ways can recognize objects down to 100 nanometers and sometimes even less than 10 nanometers. Experts attach tiny, colored glowing tags to single key molecules or bits of DNA, often in living cells where they can watch them in action. As a result, they are now filling in key knowledge gaps about how cells work and what goes wrong in neurological diseases and cancers, or during viral sickness.</p>

<p>We can really see new biology—things that we were hoping to see but hadn’t seen before, says cell element cell biologist Lothar Schermelleh, who directs an imaging center at the University of Oxford in the UK. Here’s some of what experts are learning in this new age of light microscopic viewing.</p>

<p>Super-resolution microscopic viewing uses a variety of ways to detect detail that would usually be hidden by the diffraction limit, Schermelleh explains. Single-cell element detection microscopic viewing, for instance, takes benefit of the fact that spots on an image are easier to detect the spot with exactness when they appear in isolation rather than clustered together. Experts label the tiny particles of focus with glowing tags designed to spontaneously send out light. As the detectors twinkle on and off, computer models estimate exactly where each tiny particle is located—and reconstruct a high-resolution image of the sample.</p>

<p>Another way, excited send out decrease, scans the samples with lasers that are enclosed by a second, donut-shaped ring of lasers that cancel out the glowing light about the area of focus, sharpening the microscope’s resolution. A third method, called structured illumination microscopic viewing, lights up samples with a striped pattern of light. These stripes interfere with the light coming from the sample in ways that allow experts to infer additional detail about the image.</p>
