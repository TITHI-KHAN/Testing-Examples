# Can A.I. Help Revitalize Indigenous Languages?

<p>Native researchers and roboticists are crafting new tools to help save threatened ways of speaking.</p>

<p>The robot is shaped like a soup can with a little domed head, animal ears and a charming, rounded body. Like a parrot in sea robber lore, the robot is intended to perch on a wearer’s shoulder, listening and even joining in on the talk. Unlike most parrots, it can speak fluent Anishinaabemowin, a Native language spoken by the Anishinaabe nation of North America. The robot , which uses an inside developed imitation intelligence model to learn and make new languages, is a new foray into wearable tech for language keeping alive.</p>

<p>Danielle Boyer , a 24-year-old Anishinaabe roboticist, designed the - Skobot to converse in threatened Native languages, thereby helping to keep them alive. Made of brightly colored synthetic material, the robots are changeable and often adorned with accessories from pink tutus to top hats. Growing up below the being poor line in Michigan, Boyer was inspired to make specialized education more easy to reach for Native youth like herself. Her charity——helps hand out the Skobots and teach students about the study of robots and new ideas. Her creation joins a new and burgeoning group of starting plans that use A.I. language tools to keep safe dying or threatened languages, with some arguing that such science shows promise for threatened Native languages in specific.</p>

<p>Around 40 part out of 100 of the world’s roughly 6,700 languages are at risk of dying out, and many of them are spoken by Native people. Researchers have shown that keeping these languages alive has positive effects beyond just cultural keeping alive. One study gave the idea that a connection with language heritage can match up with lower teen self-harm rates. Contact with an ancestral language has also been positively linked with body health benefits, like lower rates of diabetes or too much alcohol drinking.</p>

<p>New A.I. sciences are changing the language-learning game as teaching tools, and According to Boyer, Skobot is the one of the first toys that speaks a Native language. Inspired by talking Elmo toys, Boyer’s robot is motion-activated and uses real children’s voices to answer questions in the target language. To use it, a child or teen needs only ask the Skobot how to say a specific word or phrase. The A.I. model inside the toy then interprets the audio input and selects the correct pre-recorded audio file, simulating a talk.</p>

<p>Like the Skobot, most new A.I. sciences developed by Native experts are designed for a specific language group. Jacqueline Brixey, a computer expert before at the University of Southern California and now joining the University of Wisconsin, created a chatbot called -Masheli that can talk in Choctaw. Drawing from a gathering of animal stories, the chatbot can listen and respond to users in both English and the target language, helping talking skills.</p>
